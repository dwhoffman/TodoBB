#TodoBB

##A simple app I'm writing to learn Backbone.js

This is just me playing around with Backbone.js so that I can learn more about it and add it to my developer toolbox.

I will likely be pulling a lot of the code from the Todo app written by [http://jgn.me/]Jermoe Gravel-Niquet, and you can check out his code [http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/index.html]here.
